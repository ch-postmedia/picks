</div>
		<div>Age: 24  Size: 6’/178 lb.  Position: Centre  2020-21: Kamloops Blazers (WHL)
</div>
		<div>1. Connor Zary
</div>

		<div>1</div>
		<div>6</div>
		<div>2</div>
		<div>Button: “First of all, we talked a lot about the depth of this draft. If you get Connor Zary at 24, that tells you the talent level in this draft. .... Smart player. Good hands. Good vision. Good motor. Going into the season, we wanted to see if he could produce a little bit more offensively than he has in the past. He certainly picked it up in that regard. A multi-dimensional player who plays multiple situations. I see him as a centre but if he had to move to the wing, he’s smart enough and has good enough hands that he could do it.”</div>
		<div>8</div>
		<div>5</div>
		<div>7</div>
		<div>Age: 18  Size: 6’4”/209 lb.  Position: Defence  2020-21 team: University of Connecticut (NCAA)
</div>
		<div>2. Yan Kuznetsov</div>
		<div>Button: “One of the youngest players in NCAA hockey. Real good defensive fundamentals and a chance to grow his game offensively. But he takes care of his end first. We see him as a guy who can play with a more risk-taking offensive player in your middle pairing. If all goes well, maybe even higher.”</div>
		<div>Button: “He was a faller, as far as the draft goes and lists go. Fred Parker, with 10 or 12 picks outside of 72 said, 'Hey, if Poirier is there we have to take the risk. It’s value at that point.’ .... We had a back-up plan there in case he was taken. But we had no questions about taking him at that spot. It’s a real good pick. The kid knows where he has to go to do more of his work. The offensive part of his game comes natural for him. Now he’s gotta work on the rest of his game and that will determine his path to the NHL.”</div>
		<div>3. Jeremie Poirier</div>
		<div>Age: 18  Size: 6’/196 lb.  Position: Defence  
2020-21 team: Saint John Sea Dogs (QMHJL)
</div>
		<div>5. Daniil Chechelev</div>
		<div>Age: 19  Size: 6’3"/187 lb.  Position: Goaltender  
2020-21 team: Russkie Vityazi Chekhov/MHL
</div>
		<div>Button: “We didn’t have a lot of live viewings of him, but what we did get, we were able to turn over to our goalie department. They really hit the video hard on him. (Flames goalie coach) Jordan Sigalet and (Stockton Heat goalie coach) Thomas Speer spent a lot of time researching him and talking to goalie coaches throughout North America and Europe … we really like him and we decided to take him there.”</div>
		<div>6. Ryan Francis</div>
		<div>Button: “We have a lot of success, we feel, in the last few years in the later rounds with skill and vision and hockey sense. Even if they’re not big in stature so Ryan fit that bill. A lot of skill. A right shot.”</div>
		<div>Age: 18  Size: 5’9"/170 lb.  Position: Right wing  
2020-21 team: Cape Breton Eagles (QMJHL)
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Button: “Same as Ryan (Francis) — they’re both going to have to work on their skating but they both have things you can’t teach. So we’re really happy about getting both of them.”</div>
		<div>Age: 18  Size: 5’10"/175 lb.  Position: Centre  
2020-21 team: Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (OHL)
</div>
		<div>7. Rory Kerins</div>
		<div>Age: 20  Size: 6’2”/208 lb.  Position: Defence  
2020-21 team: Dynamo Minsk (KHL)
</div>
		<div>8. Ilya Solovyov</div>
		<div>Button: “He played in Saginaw (OHL) this year and would have played as an over-age so I think it’s a good thing he’s playing in the KHL right now because their league is playing and he needs to play. He’s a tall, rangy defenceman with reach. He’s a good puck-mover, he’s good on the powerplay. He has a lot of poise on the blueline and can move the puck along the blueline. We thought he was a real good value pick at that point of the draft.”</div>
		<div>Age: 18  Size: 6’1"/188 lb.  Position: Defence  
2020-21 team: Lincoln Stars (USHL)
</div>
		<div>4. Jake Boltmann</div>
		<div>Button: "He’s a really good skater. He’s a move-the-puck and follow the play up the ice-kind of defender rather than a puck-carrier or rusher. A real solid team guy. There’s going to be a spot for him at the NHL level if he continues his development."</div>
